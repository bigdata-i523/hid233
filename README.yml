        For years, people have been trying to reduce their automobile insurance 
        bills. Insurance companies claim that price will be reduced for good 
        drivers and raised for bad ones. However, inaccuracies in their data 
        predictions lead to the exact opposite. The dataset being used is released 
        by Porto Seguro, an auto and homeowner insurance company from Brazil. It 
        consists of information from several hundred thousands of policyholders. 
        The goal is to predict the probability an auto insurance policyholder 
        files a claim the next year using classification algorithms. A good 
        prediction with decent accuracy can correctly adjust prices for policyholders.
