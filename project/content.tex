\begin{abstract}

    For years, people have been trying to reduce their automobile
    insurance bills. Insurance companies claim that price will be
    reduced for good drivers and raised for bad ones. However,
    inaccuracies in their data predictions lead to the exact
    opposite. The dataset being used is released by Porto Seguro,
    an auto and homeowner insurance company from Brazil. It
    consists of information from several hundred thousands of
    policyholders. The goal is to predict the probability an auto
    insurance policyholder files a claim the next year using
    classification algorithms. A good prediction with decent
    accuracy can correctly adjust prices for policyholders.
